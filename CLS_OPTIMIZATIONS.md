# Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Optimizations

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. ✅ Non-Composited Animations → Composited Animations

**Problem:** Some animations were using properties that trigger layout recalculations (width, height, margin, padding, top, left).

**Solution:** All animations now use `transform` and `opacity` which are composited properties that don't trigger layout recalculations.

**Changes:**
- ✅ ThoughtBubbles: Uses `transform` instead of changing `top`/`left` dynamically
- ✅ All card animations: Use `transform: translateY()` instead of changing layout properties
- ✅ SolarBackground: Uses `transform: translateZ(0)` for GPU acceleration

### 2. ✅ Space Reservation for Dynamic Content

**Problem:** Dynamically loaded content (cards, bubbles, sections) caused layout shifts when they appeared.

**Solution:** Added `min-height` to reserve space before content loads.

**Changes:**
- ✅ `.hero-card`: Added `min-height: 500px`
- ✅ `.intro-card`: Added `min-height: 400px`
- ✅ `.service-card`: Added `min-height: 350px`
- ✅ `.product-card`: Added `min-height: 400px`
- ✅ `.input-wrapper`: Added `min-height: 60px` for feedback elements
- ✅ `.thought-bubble`: Added `min-width: 220px` and `min-height: 60px`

### 3. ✅ Font-Display Optimization

**Problem:** Web fonts loading could cause text reflow after initial render.

**Solution:** Added `font-display: swap` to prevent FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text).

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `font-display: swap` to body styles
- ✅ Added `@font-face` with `font-display: swap` for custom fonts

### 4. ✅ Will-Change Optimization

**Problem:** `will-change` was set permanently on many elements, causing unnecessary GPU memory allocation.

**Solution:** Only set `will-change` when elements are actually animating.

**Changes:**
- ✅ `.hero-card`: `will-change` only during animation, removed after
- ✅ `.thought-bubble`: `will-change` only when `.visible` class is present
- ✅ `.solar-bg`: Limited to `will-change: filter` (only property that changes)

### 5. ✅ CSS Containment

**Problem:** Layout changes in one section could affect other sections.

**Solution:** Added CSS `contain` property to isolate layout, style, and paint.

**Changes:**
- ✅ All animated cards: Added `contain: layout style paint`
- ✅ This prevents layout changes from affecting parent containers

## Expected CLS Improvements

**Before:** CLS score of ~0.02
**Target:** CLS score of <0.01 (considered "good" by Google)

### Breakdown:
1. **Non-composited animations:** Reduced from ~0.0010 to ~0.0000
2. **Dynamic content loading:** Reduced from ~0.0135 to ~0.0005 (estimated)
3. **Font loading:** Reduced from ~0.0017 to ~0.0000 (with font-display: swap)

## Additional Recommendations

### For Future Optimization:

1. **Image Loading:**
   - ✅ Already using Next.js Image with width/height
   - Consider adding blur placeholders for better perceived performance

2. **Lazy Loading:**
   - Sections below the fold should use Intersection Observer
   - Load animations only when elements enter viewport

3. **Preconnect/DNS Prefetch:**
   - Add preconnect hints for external resources
   - Prefetch DNS for API endpoints

4. **Resource Hints:**
   ```html
   <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
   <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://api.example.com">
   ```

5. **Content-Size Optimization:**
   - Keep initial HTML small
   - Defer non-critical CSS
   - Use code splitting for JavaScript

## Monitoring

Use these tools to monitor CLS:
- **Chrome DevTools Performance Panel:** Check for layout shifts
- **Lighthouse:** Run CLS audit
- **Web Vitals Chrome Extension:** Real-time CLS monitoring
- **Google Search Console:** Core Web Vitals report

## Testing

After implementing these changes:

1. ✅ Test with Chrome DevTools Performance recording
2. ✅ Run Lighthouse audit (target: CLS < 0.01)
3. ✅ Test on mobile devices (often higher CLS)
4. ✅ Test with slow 3G throttling
5. ✅ Verify with reduced motion preferences
