# Performance Optimization Implementation Guide

## Quick Wins Implemented

### 1. Background Animation Optimization

**Issue:** Heavy GPU usage from complex animations  
**Solution:** Add performance detection and reduce animations on low-end devices

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [x] Add hardware detection
- [x] Reduce animation layers on mobile
- [x] Implement FPS monitoring
- [x] Add reduced motion support

### 2. API Security Hardening

**Issue:** Basic XSS protection, in-memory rate limiting  
**Solution:** Implement proper sanitization and Redis-based rate limiting

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Install DOMPurify for input sanitization
- [ ] Set up Redis for rate limiting
- [ ] Add environment variable validation
- [ ] Implement request logging

### 3. Image Optimization

**Issue:** Images not fully optimized  
**Solution:** Use Next.js Image with proper placeholders and sizes

**Status:** Partially implemented - needs blur placeholders

## Monitoring Setup

### Recommended Tools
- **Performance:** Lighthouse CI, Web Vitals
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry or Rollbar
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics 4 or Plausible
- **APM:** New Relic or DataDog (backend)

### Key Metrics to Track
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- API response times
- Error rates
